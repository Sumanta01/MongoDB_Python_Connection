# MongoDB_Python_Connection
MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that stores data in a JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON). It's often used for handling unstructured or semi-structured data and is particularly well-suited for applications with dynamic schema requirements.

To work with MongoDB in Python, you can use the pymongo library, which provides a Python API for interacting with MongoDB.
